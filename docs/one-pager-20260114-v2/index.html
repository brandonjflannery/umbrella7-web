        <div class="founder-name">Brandon Flannery</div>
        <p>
          Brandon began his career at <strong>Pluribus Labs</strong>, which was acquired by Golden Gate Capital in 2017
          to form an internal hedge fund. He developed an institutional asset management platform that was subsequently
          sold to Exos Financial in 2022. Brandon also founded <strong>MB Computing</strong>, creating and operating
          eight data centers across the United States and Canada. These facilities featured grid-connected operations
          alongside gas-to-power systems with complete off-grid functionality. This combination of quantitative
          finance, ML engineering, and physical infrastructure expertise enables Umbrella 7 to deliver end-to-end
          solutions that bridge technical implementation with measurable business outcomes.
